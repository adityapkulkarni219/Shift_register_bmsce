## How it works
The shift register has:
•	Inputs:
  o	clk → Clock signal
  o	reset → Clears the register to 0
  o	load → If 1, loads data directly from parallel_load
  o	direction → Shift direction (0 = right, 1 = left)
  o	serial_input → Bit shifted in during shift operations
  o	parallel_load[3:0] → 4-bit data to load in parallel
•	Output:
  o	parallel_out[3:0] → Current value of the shift register

How It Works (Step by Step)
1. Reset
   When reset=1, no matter what else is happening, the register is cleared to 0000.
2. Parallel Load
   When load=1, the register ignores shifting and directly loads the 4-bit input parallel_load.
   Example: if parallel_load = 1011, then parallel_out = 1011 on next clock.
3. Shift Operations
   1. Shift Right (direction = 0)
      •	Shifts everything to the right.
      •	parallel_out[3] gets the new serial_input.
      •	Bits [3:1] shift into [2:0].
      •	The old parallel_out[0] is dropped.
      Example:
        -> parallel_out = 1011, serial_input=1
        -> After clock → parallel_out = 1101.
   2.Shift Left (direction = 1)
      •	Shifts everything to the left.
      •	parallel_out[0] gets the new serial_input.
      •	Bits [2:0] shift into [3:1].
      •	The old parallel_out[3] is dropped.
      Example:
        -> parallel_out = 1011, serial_input=0
        -> After clock → parallel_out = 0110  
4. Default
   If somehow direction is invalid (shouldn’t happen since it’s 1 bit), output clears to 0000.
